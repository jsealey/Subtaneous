=====================================================================

Subtaneous is an open source, collaborative editor plugin built in [Python v3.3.0](http://www.python.org/) for the text editor, Sublime Text 2. Essentially, we hope to make Subtaneous the go-to plugin to allow multiple collaborators to code simultaneously on one file; opening new doors into the world of collaborative programming.

Additionals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subtaneous incorporates the [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) framework for networking and connections and [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html) for documentation building.
